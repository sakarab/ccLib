**ccLib** is not a framework, is not a general purpose library nor does it cover any special domain. It is rather a collection of utility functions and helper classes, used in several programs being developed, all in one place.

It is advised NOT to use this library directly in your code, as changes, although for the better, will be unexpected, with no much concern about backwards compatibility, and may break your code. If you DO use it, you are on your own.

You have been warned.
